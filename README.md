# fyp

Environment used: Python 3 + Jupyter Notebook

Libraries used:
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

Installed all of the above using Anaconda Individual Edition.

To execute:
Git clone the repository.
Run the "Data analysis.ipynb" notebook.

Note:  The "Data analysis.ipynb" notebook loads DataFrames that were loaded from the original source BLM data CSV files and saved ("pickled") by the "Data collection.ipynb" notebook.  The original BLM data CSV files are not provided due to the size - 11 GB.  The "Data collection.ipynb" notebook therefore cannot be rrun unless these files are obtained.  The "pickled" DataFrames are therefore provided as they are of small file size and are ultimately what are used in the "Data analysis.ipynb" notebook.

Instead of executing the notebook, one can simply view the notebook source code and precomputed cell output in the web browser at GitHub:
